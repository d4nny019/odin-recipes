            <li>2 ½ cups vegetarian chicken-flavored broth</li>
            <li>2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>½ medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked orzo pasta</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 hard cheese rind</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>½ cup finely grated Grana Padano cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                <p>Pour vegetarian chicken broth and vegetable broth into a medium saucepan over over medium heat; bring to a boil.</p>
                <p>Reduce heat to simmer and cover until needed.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                <p>Melt butter and oil together in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion, pepper flakes, and a pinch of sea salt and pepper.</p>
                <p>Cook and stir for about 4 minutes before adding the zucchini and another pinch of sea salt. Stir and continue to cook for about 3 minutes.</p>
                <p>Next, stir in the dry orzo pasta and continue to cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                <p>Pour in wine, stirring as it bubbles until the rapid bubbling stops. Pour in hot broth and bring to a boil.</p>
                <p>Reduce heat slightly and add cheese rind and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. Cook and stir until a good portion of the liquid has been soaked up by the orzo, about 10 minutes.</p>
                <p>Stir in asparagus and frozen peas and continue to simmer until nearly all of the liquid is gone and orzo is fully cooked, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
                <p>Stir in Grana Padano cheese, parsley, lemon zest and juice, and desired amount of cracked pepper. Remove and discard cheese rind. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as desired.</p>
        </ol>
